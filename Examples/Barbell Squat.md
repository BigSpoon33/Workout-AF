# Barbell Squat

The fundamental lower body exercise. Builds leg strength, core stability, and overall athleticism.

## Form Cues

1. **Bar Position**: Rest bar on upper traps (high bar) or rear delts (low bar)
2. **Stance**: Feet shoulder width, toes slightly out
3. **Brace**: Big breath, brace core like expecting a punch
4. **Descent**: Push hips back and down, knees track over toes
5. **Depth**: Hip crease below knee (parallel or below)
6. **Drive**: Push through whole foot, squeeze glutes at top
7. **Lockout**: Full hip extension, don't hyperextend

## Common Mistakes

- Knees caving inward
- Rising on toes
- Butt wink (excessive lumbar flexion)
- Not hitting depth
- Looking down (keep neutral spine)

## Variations

- **Front Squat** - More quad focus, more upright torso
- **Goblet Squat** - Great for learning movement
- **Box Squat** - Teaches proper depth
- **Pause Squat** - Builds strength out of the hole

## Progression

- Add 5-10 lbs when you can complete all sets with good form
- Focus on depth and control before adding weight
