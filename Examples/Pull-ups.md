# Pull-ups

The ultimate bodyweight back builder. Tests and develops upper body pulling strength.

## Form Cues

1. **Grip**: Overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulders
2. **Hang**: Start from dead hang, arms fully extended
3. **Engage**: Depress and retract shoulder blades
4. **Pull**: Drive elbows down and back
5. **Top**: Chin over bar, chest to bar if possible
6. **Lower**: Control the descent, full extension at bottom

## Common Mistakes

- Kipping or swinging
- Not using full range of motion
- Shrugging shoulders at top
- Using momentum instead of muscle

## Variations

- **Chin-ups** - Underhand grip, more bicep emphasis
- **Neutral Grip** - Palms facing each other
- **Wide Grip** - More lat emphasis
- **Weighted Pull-ups** - Add weight with belt or vest

## Progression

### Can't do pull-ups yet?
1. **Negatives** - Jump to top, lower slowly (5 seconds)
2. **Band Assisted** - Loop band around bar and foot
3. **Lat Pulldowns** - Build strength first

### Already strong?
1. Add weight with dip belt
2. Work toward muscle-ups
3. Try one-arm progressions
