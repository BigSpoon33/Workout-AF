# Romanian Deadlift (RDL)

A hip-hinge movement that builds the entire posterior chain, especially hamstrings and glutes.

## Form Cues

1. **Setup**: Stand with feet hip-width, bar at hip level
2. **Grip**: Overhand or mixed grip, just outside legs
3. **Hinge**: Push hips back, slight knee bend
4. **Lower**: Keep bar close to legs, feel hamstring stretch
5. **Depth**: Lower until hamstring stretch limits you (usually mid-shin)
6. **Drive**: Squeeze glutes, thrust hips forward to stand

## Key Points

- Bar stays close to body entire movement
- Back stays flat - no rounding
- Knees stay soft but don't bend more during descent
- Feel the stretch in hamstrings, not lower back

## Common Mistakes

- Bending knees too much (turns into conventional deadlift)
- Rounding lower back
- Bar drifting away from legs
- Going too heavy before mastering form

## Variations

- **Single Leg RDL** - Unilateral version for balance
- **Dumbbell RDL** - Good for beginners
- **Stiff Leg Deadlift** - Less knee bend, more hamstring
- **Banded RDL** - Constant tension throughout
