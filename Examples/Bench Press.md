# Bench Press

The king of chest exercises. A compound movement that builds upper body pushing strength.

## Form Cues

1. **Setup**: Lie flat on bench, eyes under the bar
2. **Grip**: Slightly wider than shoulder width
3. **Arch**: Slight natural arch in lower back, shoulder blades pinched together
4. **Unrack**: Lift bar off rack with straight arms
5. **Lower**: Bring bar to mid-chest, elbows at 45° angle
6. **Press**: Drive through feet, push bar up and slightly back
7. **Lockout**: Full arm extension at top

## Common Mistakes

- Bouncing bar off chest
- Flaring elbows too wide (90°)
- Lifting hips off bench
- Not retracting shoulder blades

## Variations

- **Incline Bench Press** - Targets upper chest
- **Close Grip Bench** - Emphasizes triceps
- **Dumbbell Bench Press** - Greater range of motion
- **Pause Bench** - Pause at chest for 1-2 seconds

## Progression

- Add 5 lbs when you can complete all sets with good form
- Consider microloading (2.5 lb plates) for steady progress
